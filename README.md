# pyencrypt
Simple encryption tool written in python :)

## Install
Make sure you have Python ```>v3.12``` and ```pipx``` installed.
Installing [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#install-pipx) is highly recommended.
If you have pipx, run ```pipx install git+https://github.com/ton1cwater/pyencrypt/```
Now you can type ```pyencrypt``` in the terminal to run.

### Without pipx:
Download project and cd into directory.

```.venv/Scripts/activate```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```python -m pyencrypt.py```
